# Hallunix

**Hallunix** is an AI-simulated Unix-like environment.  
It mimics a Linux shell/OS by routing all commands through an LLM via [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm).  

Hallunix starts with a neofetch-style logo, provides a prompt (`user@hallunix:~$ `), and responds to commands realistically â€” including interactive interpreters like Python. Session history is ephemeral (per run) and no real commands are executed on your machine.

## Features

- **LLM-driven OS simulation**: every command is interpreted and answered by a large language model.
- **Authentic UX**:  
  - Startup neofetch logo with system details.  
  - Prompts (`user@hallunix:~$ `, `>>> `) controlled by the model.  
  - Prompts end with a single space and cannot be backspaced into (protected by `readline`).  
- **Interactive interpreters**: switch into Python (`python`) or similar REPLs naturally.
- **History command**: `:history` shows all inputs from the current session.
- **Ephemeral state**: no persistence across runs.
- **Streaming output** (optional): stream results as they arrive, or disable with `--no-stream`.
